# Person-Detection-in-Video

This code uses the pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for full body detection which is a machine learning object detection method used to identify objects in images or video. The classifier is trained on a dataset of positive and negative images, where positive images contain the object of interest (in this case, full bodies of people) and negative images do not.

It's important to note that Haar cascades are not as accurate as other models such as YOLO or Faster R-CNN, and that they can also be sensitive to lighting conditions, and the orientation of the person in the image.

Make sure that you have the file "haarcascade_fullbody.xml"
